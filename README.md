Network Integration and Configuration: A CCNA Packet Tracer Simulation
</h4>

## Project Overview
"Network Integration and Configuration" is a detailed Packet Tracer simulation project reflecting a comprehensive network system as found in real-world enterprise settings. This simulation was meticulously crafted to incorporate various CCNA-level networking technologies and protocols, representing the interconnected nature of modern network environments.

## Features and Capabilities

- **Sophisticated Network Topology**: Features a multi-layer network structure with core, distribution, and access layers, facilitating a robust and scalable network design.
- **Layer 2 Configurations**: Includes VLAN setup, EtherChannel for link aggregation, and STP configurations to prevent Layer 2 loops.
- **Layer 3 Routing**: Employs OSPF and EIGRP protocols to ensure dynamic and efficient routing across various network segments.
- **Redundancy Protocols**: Integrates HSRP to provide network redundancy and ensure high availability of routing paths.
- **WAN Technologies**: Configures WAN connections using Frame Relay and PPP, essential for establishing and maintaining remote connectivity.
- **Security Implementations**: Utilizes ACLs to enforce security policies and port security features to protect against unauthorized access.
- **NAT**: Implements Network Address Translation to conserve IP addresses and facilitate internal-external network communication.
- **DHCP**: Sets up DHCP servers for automatic IP address allocation within the network.

## Technical Stack

- **Cisco Packet Tracer**: Utilized as the primary tool for network simulation and visualization.
- **Networking Protocols**: Includes a wide array of protocols such as OSPF, EIGRP, STP, HSRP, DHCP, NAT, PPP, and Frame Relay for a comprehensive networking experience.
